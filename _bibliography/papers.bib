	abstract = {For many children of immigrants to Europe, being born in a European country does not give them rights of citizenship. To acquire citizenship of the country of their birth, they typically rely on their parents’ naturalisation. While many European countries have tightened requirements for citizenship over recent decades, the impact of new regulations on immigrants’ children propensity to naturalise has gone largely unexplored. This paper analyses the impact of two restrictive legislative changes in the Netherlands: the re-introduction of a dual citizenship restriction in 1997, and the introduction of civic integration requirements in 2003. Using register data and event-history models, we analyse the acquisition of Dutch citizenship by children born in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2010 to immigrant parents. We find that the dual citizenship restriction puts families off naturalising while mandatory civic integration sees them postpone naturalisation. The intergenerational impact of naturalisation reforms is also reflected in the extent to which both parents are involved in the naturalisation process. Children eligible under stricter requirements are more likely to naturalise with one parent instead of both, in contrast to earlier eligibility cohorts. These findings shed light on key family dynamics in the acquisition of host country citizenship.},

	abstract = {How do routine tasks shape disparities in income and employment prospects between workers with vocational and tertiary educational qualifications? Whereas existing research predominantly emphasizes skill differentials as the primary driver, this study proposes that group differences in the prevalence and returns to routine tasks contribute to existing disparities. Using decomposition methods on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and the BiBB/BAuA Employment Survey, we examine how compositional differences in routine task performance between vocational and tertiary graduates impact disparities in labor market outcomes over workers’ careers. We find that vocationally trained workers, on average, perform more routine tasks than their university-educated counterparts. This compositional difference explains 11\% of the income gap between both groups but does not matter for unemployment risk. Over the career, group-specific levels of task routineness remain surprisingly stable for both groups. However, the returns to routine tasks diminish with age, disproportionately affecting vocationally trained workers due to higher average routine scores and contributing substantially to the widening income gap between vocational and tertiary graduates over their careers.},

            Various studies suggest a positive effect of host country citizenship on the educational outcomes of immigrants’ children. However, little is known about when and for whom citizenship matters and how much this is affected by potential endogeneity in the relationship between parental citizenship acquisition and their children’s educational outcomes. Focusing on the Netherlands, this article exploits siblings’ variation in their exposure to naturalization in order to net out the effect of time-constant parental characteristics. Results from a linear mixed model show that children who acquire Dutch citizenship have a substantial advantage in terms of academic performance over those who are still foreign citizens, especially if they naturalized in early childhood. A novel bounding estimator that gauges the sensitivity of the estimates to omitted variable bias confirms the robustness of these results. Moreover, the effects of citizenship are concentrated among students whose parents are at a disadvantage in the labour market and housing market, shedding light on hitherto under-explored effect heterogeneity.},

Pourtant, une ethnographie des Antigones trois ans après leur création permet d’éclairer des éléments moins saillants de leurs engagement et discours : les enquêtées cherchent à poser les bases d’un féminisme qui leur permette de penser conjointement leur désir d’émancipation, et leur attachement à des valeurs politiques, religieuses et morales issues de leurs socialisations familiales, scolaires, et militantes. Les questions relatives à la sexualité sont ainsi abordées à l’aune d’une conception anticapitaliste, différentialiste et spirituelle des femmes et de leur cause, qui met à distance les arguments théologiques ou doctrinaux.},

	abstract = {Occupations are a central unit for understanding inequality in the labor market, yet we know little about why occupations matter. The existing literature often assumes that occupations are distinct bundles of skills, so skills are rarely conceptualized and measured independently of occupations. How does this limit our understanding of wage inequality? In this article, we use a unique dataset of millions of online job postings in the United Kingdom to capture the skill content of work at the job level and analyze its relationship to existing occupational classifications. While previous literature has often defined different skills as uni-dimensional and independent from each other, we propose a skill profile approach to capture the combination of skills that workers need on the job. Using topic modeling on highly detailed job skill requirements, we identify the skill profiles of job postings and analyze the extent to which they affect wages within or across occupational categories. Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity in skill content within occupations, and show that both job-level skills and occupations are key to explaining wage differentials across jobs. These findings challenge the often assumed role of occupations as bundles of skills, and offer new perspectives for analyzing labor market stratification.},

	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the relationship between citizenship and the educational outcomes of native-born children of immigrants in the Netherlands. As in many countries of the world, children born in the Netherlands do not have rights to the citizenship of their country of birth but instead inherit the citizenship of their parents. Little is known about whether and how such citizenship laws affect their legal status and life course. Based on administrative register data, the dissertation uses quantitative methods to map the patterns of citizenship acquisition among the children of immigrants and to analyse its effects on their educational trajectories and performance. Findings indicate that children who acquired Dutch citizenship have a substantial educational advantage over those who are still foreign citizens. Yet the effects of citizenship are not uniform: Dutch citizenship matters especially when acquired in early childhood, and by families facing structural constraints in the host society. The dissertation therefore provides a better understanding of the relevance of citizenship for children of immigrants, taking into account their life course and family environment.},

	abstract = {During recent decades, the educational outcomes of the children of immigrants have been extensively studied, with a growing emphasis on the heterogeneity of the so-called second generation. Yet, the impact of host country citizenship on children's educational outcomes has only received limited attention so far, although children of immigrants do not get automatic birthright citizenship in most European countries. Focusing on the Netherlands, this paper compares educational trajectories among citizen and non-citizen children of immigrants. Register data and sequence analysis are used to map and cluster the trajectories of a full cohort of second-generation students from the start of secondary school. We apply a variant of optimal matching focusing on sequences of transitions, which enables us to uncover different patterns of (im)mobility within a stratified school system better than the standard approach. Multinomial logistic regressions show that students who acquire Dutch citizenship are significantly more likely to follow upward trajectories, taking advantage of the system's flexibility and “back doors”. Conversely, not having Dutch citizenship is associated with a higher risk of dropout and school interruptions. These findings are in line with our theoretical expectation that, during the naturalisation process, parents acquire or further develop important resources for navigating a complex educational system such as the Dutch one.},
