My research focuses on social stratification and mobility using quantitative methods. I am particularly interested in analyzing the development of inequalities over the life course of individuals in relation to institutional conditions.</p> <p>My current work in the (CAREER ERC project)[https://careerproject.eu/] focuses on the employment trajectories of workers in the context of changing labor markets. I use job advertisement data and machine learning techniques to map the evolution of demand for skills over the last decade, and analyze how this affects the individual careers of workers.</p> </body></html>
