I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Sociology at the University of Amsterdam since September 2021. My research focuses on social stratification and mobility using quantitative methods. I am particularly interested in analyzing the development of inequalities over the life course of individuals in relation to institutional conditions. 

My current work in the [CAREER ERC project](https://careerproject.eu/) focuses on the employment trajectories of workers in the context of changing labor markets. I use job advertisement data and machine learning techniques to map the evolution of demand for skills over the last decade, and analyze how this affects the individual careers of workers.
